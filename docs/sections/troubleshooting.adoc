=== Logo Error
If you receive this error:

----
  convert: no decode delegate for this image format `IMAGE' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/556.
  convert: no images defined `/visualization/resources/logo_txfrmed.image' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3273.
----

This means the image file passed into *Envisaged Redux* is not readable by the image converter onboard (ImageMagick). Try using another format or image.

----
  Video can't be played because the file is corrupt
----

This is a known issue. Refreshing the page brings you right back to the latest live preview, and is the current workaround for this issue.
