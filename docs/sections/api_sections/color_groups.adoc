=== Color Groups

NOTE: This feature does not apply to <<_custom_log,Custom Log>> inputs.

The Color Groups feature of *Envisaged Redux* colors each branch of the Gource tree to a pseudo-random color.
Each branch will have it's own color, and all sub branches and nodes will share the same color.
For single-repo cases, each branch represents a parent directory in the repository.
For multi-repo cases, each branch represents a repository.

TIP: This feature is useful when you wish to highlight multiple groups working on various components of a project or system.

By default, if Color Groups is not enabled, each node in the Gource tree is colored based on the file type.
Color Groups is enabled by setting the boolean variable <<_runtime_color_groups,`RUNTIME_COLOR_GROUPS`>> to `1`.

Additional variables to configure Color Groups can be found at the <<_color_groups_environment_variables,Color Groups Environment Variables>> section.

==== Modes

There are two modes of operation for Color Groups:

===== Random

By default this is the default mode of operation. This will generate close-to-true random colors to the coloring mechanism.

===== Seeded Random

For some cases, we may want to have the same color assignments for our branches. 
We can achieve this by providing a seed value to <<_color_groups_seed,COLOR_GROUPS_SEED>>.
This will mean that if you run the same visualization job with the same <<_color_groups_seed,COLOR_GROUPS_SEED>> provided, you should get the same colors mapped to the same branches every time.
This can provide a replicable way to have color groups in your visualization.
