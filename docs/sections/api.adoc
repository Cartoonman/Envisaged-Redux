This is the documentation detailing the API for *Envisaged Redux*.
Environment Variables are passed as inputs into *Envisaged Redux* through the `--env` or `-e` flag in `docker run`.
For mount points, the examples provided give you the exact syntax needed.
Through a combination of Environment Variables and Mounts, there is a wide array of configurations you can use to customize how *Envisaged Redux* renders your visualization.
