# Envisaged-Redux
**Powered by Gource, FFmpeg, and the Gallium LLVMPipe Driver**

## About

**Envisaged Redux** is a Docker container application that combines the power of Gource and FFmpeg to generate visualizations of Git commit history. 

What makes this stand apart from other similar containerized applications is its portable-focused approach. **Envisaged Redux** can and will run on any platform that supports Docker, and it requires no extra hardware support to run (e.g. GPU's). This enables **Envisaged Redux** to be used in CI/CD chains and basic cloud VPS services without issue. This is achieved by leveraging the Gallium LLVMPipe Driver and Xvfb to render in software.
